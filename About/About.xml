	<description>Adds a quest that allows pawns to join other friendly factions permanently.

Too often, someone joins your colony, claiming they have nowhere else to go. And because of your Ideology™ (DLC not required), you can't just turn them away! Well, now they do have somewhere else to go! This quest gives you a nice, moral way to get rid of colonists you don't want hanging around - on top of a neat reward for doing so.

Colonists you give away are set to belong to that new faction. Good chance you'll see them again in caravans - or in raids!

This quest is heavily based off the Pawn Lending quest from Royalty™ (DLC not required), and its rewards/regularity/etc.

Compatibility:
Shouldn't have any problems with other mods or new saves.
If you do find an issue, let me know and I'll get right on it.</description>
